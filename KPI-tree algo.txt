This is the algorithm of KPI tree:
1) import all the required modules
2) connect to mysql and pull the node and nodedata table.
3) select the required columns from both the tables.
4) create a tree data using the left join on the tables using node-id
5) get the required products values in list.
6) pull the BA volumes data from the excel
7) transpose the BA-volumes data and add to a list.
8) get all the quantity data from the tree data by filtering the node having quantity.
9) filter the quantity data for the required products in step 5.
10) transpose and transform the quantity data to get them in same format as ba.volume.
11) For the KPI(TNS,MAT,IDC ..) filter the tree data to get the actuals of it.
12) transpose and transform similar to above steps.
13) merge the KPI actuals and quantity data.
14) Join the data from 13th step with ba.volume data.
15) transform and run the ML model
